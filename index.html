        <h3>I grew up in Easton just south of Fresno. My family is involved in the dairy and almond growing industries. I went to Washington Union High School, and fun fact I did my senior project on Computer Engineering with Irma. AFter high school, I went on to major in Computer Engineering at Cal Poly and offically graduated in December 2018. My college senior project was an iOS app that allows you to manage a dairy herd via a tablet synced with a Firebase Database. I'm now beginning to apply for jobs in the bay area, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Monica, and Fresno. </h3>
